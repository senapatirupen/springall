Running Spring Boot application:
java -jar todo-in-memory-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --port=8787

NoSql DB:
•  Column (Cassandra, HBase, etc.)
•  Document (CouchDB, MongoDB, etc.)
•  Key-Value (Redis, Riak, etc.)
•  Graph (Neo4J, Virtuoso, etc.)
•  Multimodel (OrientDB, ArangoDB, etc.)

Note: how did this code run? remember that we had marked the class as @Configurationand we had declared a @Beanthat returns a 
CommandLineRunnerinterface. Spring boot execute this bean after it finish wiring up all the Spring beans and before the app starts; so it’s a nice way to 
execute code (like an initialization) before the app runs.
